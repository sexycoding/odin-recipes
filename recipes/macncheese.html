        <p>Keep in mind this recipe is meant to be more like general guidlines. The 
            ingredients do not need to be exact and you can use similar types depending

            <li>Pepper</li>

        <h2>Optional but really nice to have:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Garlic Salt (or powder or fresh cloves)</li>
            <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="notes">I suggest pulling all your refrigerated ingredients out at the 
            beginning of cooking so that they can come up to room temperature. 
            Everything melts better if it's been warmed up a wee bit. 
        </p>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a pot about 3/4 with water. Give a few shakes of salt into the water
               and then place on your stove to boil. I usually set the heat nice and 
               high so that we can get a rolling boil going quickly.
            </li>
            <li>When the water is boiling fill to the water line with pasta. Cover and reduce
              heat by a few clicks to med high (or 8 on electric). Cook until pasta is just
              soft, about 10 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>Turn off heat and strain pasta. Quickly return pasta to the pot</li>
            <li>Cut off about 1/4 of a stick of butter and throw it on top of the noodles</li>
            <li>Throw on a few handfuls of cheese (or a handful of nutritional yeast if you arent
                doing any dairy). You want enough cheese to cover the 
            noodles and then some. Create a small mound. DONT STIR YET! </li>
            <li>Put one squirt of mustard on top of the cheese.</li>
            <li>Do a few shakes of salt (or garlic salt if your fancy), and your 
             other seasonings to your liking.
            </li>
            <li>Stir everything up, making sure the butter is melting. If you 
              were too slow and things arent melting, put the pot back on the burner. If you
              have an electric stove, the residual heat from cooking is enough, otherwise 
              turn the burner on the lowest setting you can. 
            </li>
            <li>The cheese will probably look a little stringy, which is ok. Add a few splashes
                of milk (or milk substitute) and start stirring it in. Keep adding milk in small
                amounts and stirring gently until the sauce is the consistency you like. 
            </li>
            <li>If you accidently add too much milk, just throw a fine layer of
                nutritional yeast on top and stir it in. It adds a nice flavor
                and will help thicken things up!
            </li>
        </ol>
