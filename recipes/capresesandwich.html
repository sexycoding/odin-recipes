        <h1>Caprese Sandwich</h1>
        <h2>Delicious Simplicity</h2>
        <img class="imgsize" src="../images/caprese-sandwich.webp" alt="a caprese sandwich">
        <p>This classic simple Italian delacy is loved by many and feared by those
            who are lactose intolerant. My mother used to force us to eat them
            every single night, and if we didnt finish we were sent to bed
            without anything else.
        </p> Many have fond memories of enjoying a caprese sandwich out on the
        river with their friends and family. Some people complain about how 
        most of these recipes go on and on with their wacky anecdotes before
        giving you the simple recipe you actually came here for, but I find
        it somehow comforting and not maddening at all.
        <p>
