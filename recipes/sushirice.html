        <p>Fish, fish, everywhere, but not a drop to... drink? Fish have existed for 
            many years, and yet we are just now discovering their amazing nutritional
            potential. I remember the days of my mother, taking us all down to the 
            pond next to the ol' radioactive waste treatment plant. We would swim and
            play in the magical glowing water, while our mother would scoop lazy, tired
            fish from the pond. She would bake the fish and they had an almost magical
            taste.
